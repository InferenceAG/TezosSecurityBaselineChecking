# Testcase title: Tickets - Create ticket - lambda case 3 - string

## Description
Naively* trying to create an own ticket from scratch.

We assume that the ticket is just a (pair string cty nat) and can "easily" be created using a lambda.

* Naively - meaning: WE just try it without thinking whether this test makes sense in regards with the used underlying architecture. We think of the underlying architecture (type system, stack separation, etc.) as a black box.
